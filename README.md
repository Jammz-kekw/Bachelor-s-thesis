# Attention-Enhanced Unpaired xAI-GANs for Transformation of Histological Stain Images

## Introduction

Welcome to the official repository of Attention-Enhanced xAI-CycleGAN, an advanced neural network architecture designed for transforming histological images. This project aims to generate p63-stained images from H&E-stained slides for metaplastic breast cancer analysis, addressing the high costs and potential tissue damage associated with direct p63 staining procedures.

## Key Features

- **Advanced CycleGAN Architecture:** Utilizes an enhanced CycleGAN architecture, xAI-CycleGAN, incorporating context-based loss and convolutional attention mechanisms to maintain structural integrity and detail distinction.
- **Efficient and Robust:** Improved structure with attention-based skip-connection merging and a modified context-preserving loss mechanism, ensuring the preservation of structural and semantic information.
- **Semantically Significant Editing:** Employs an adapted version of the SeFa algorithm for semantically interpretable editing, allowing for modifications at various 'significance' steps.
